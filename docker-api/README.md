# ProximaX Sirius TESTNET Onboarding for API node

## OS Requirements
Ensure that your local network allows inbound/outbound traffic on these ports:
- 3000/tcp
- 7900/tcp
- 7901/tcp
- 7902/tcp

A note on System Requirements:
Theoretically, this dockerized Sirius API package can run on any OS running Docker version 19.03.3 and docker-compose version 1.24.0.

The API node has 3 components:  sirius chain, Mongo and rest gateway.  We were able to run the API node on a AWS EC2 T3a.small with specs of 2 vCPU and 2GiB RAM.  We recommend a min. 2GB RAM as Mongo DB can be memory intensive.

This README was prepared by testing the package on:
- Debian 10 ++
- Ubuntu 19.04 ++
- CentOS 7 ++

## Pre-requisite
This onboarding method requires `docker` and `docker-compose`.  

Run the following command to install `docker`:
```
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sh get-docker.sh
```

A good practice is to use Docker as a non-root.  As highlighted by the post-installation message, you can use Docker as a non-root user with something like:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
where `$USER` is your username.

Installation instructions for docker-compose can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). 

Enable and start Docker:
```
$ sudo systemctl enable docker.service
$ sudo systemctl start docker.service
$ sudo systemctl status docker.service
```

## Download and Extract the package
```
$ wget https://github.com/proximax-storage/xpx-testnet-chain-onboarding/releases/download/release-v0.6.2-buster/public-testnet-api-package-v0.6.2.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf public-testnet-api-package-v0.6.2.tar.gz
$ cd public-testnet-api-package-v0.6.2
```

## Generate a keypair
```
$ tools/generate_key_pair
```

## Insert private key in [config-user.properties](resources/config-user.properties)

Replace `BOOTKEY_PRIVATE_KEY` with the generated private key. This is the account which holds the node reputation.

```
[account]

bootKey = BOOTKEY_PRIVATE_KEY 

[storage]

dataDirectory = /data
pluginsDirectory = 
```

## Update rest gateway configuration file in [rest.json](restuserconfig/rest.json)

Replace `REST_PRIVATE_KEY` and `BOOTKEY_PUBLIC_KEY` with the generated keys from the above mentioned script.

```
{
    "network": {
        "name": "publicTest",
        "description": "ProximaX Sirius Chain Brimstone Test Network"
    },

    "port": 3000,
    "crossDomainHttpMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "OPTIONS"],
    "cors": "*",
    "clientPrivateKey": "REST_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "extensions": ["accountLink", "accountProperties", "aggregate", "exchange", "config", "lock", "metadata", "mosaic", "multisig", "namespace", "operation", "receipts", "richlist", "service", "supercontract", "transfer", "upgrade"],
    "db": {
        "url": "mongodb://db:27017/",
        "name": "catapult",
        "pageSizeMin": 10,
        "pageSizeMax": 100,
        "pageSizeStep": 25,
        "maxConnectionAttempts": 5,
        "baseRetryDelay": 500
    },

    "apiNode": {
        "host": "catapult-api-node",
        "port": 7900,
        "publicKey": "BOOTKEY_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "timeout": 1000
    },
...
```

## Assign a friendly name in  [config-node.properties](resources/config-node.properties) (OPTIONAL)

Add the domain name or public IP address to the `host` parameter, leave empty to auto-detect. Add a `friendlyName` to assign a name to your node (like: testnet-donaldduck-01).

```
[localnode]

host =
friendlyName =
version = 0
roles = API
```

## Delegated Validating
You may activate your account for delegated validating by running the following tool:
```
$ tools/delegate_validating_testnet
```

After running the above tool, add the delegated remote account private key in the [config-harvesting.properties](resources/config-harvesting.properties):
```
[harvesting]
# private keys are 64 characters
harvestKey = REMOTE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY
beneficiary = 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
isAutoHarvestingEnabled = true
maxUnlockedAccounts = 5
```

Verify that your account has successfully activated delegated validation by checking the explorer using the generated transaction hash or using your account address.

## Start the API Node
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Check if containers are running
```
$ docker-compose ps
```
You should see something similar like the following:
```
Name                                  Command                        State       Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
catapult-config_catapult-api-node_1   /bin/bash -c rm -f /data/s ...   Up       0.0.0.0:7900->7900/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7901->7901/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7902->7902/tcp
catapult-config_db_1                  docker-entrypoint.sh bash  ...   Up       27017/tcp
catapult-config_init-db_1             docker-entrypoint.sh bash  ...   Exit 0
catapult-config_rest-gateway_1        docker-entrypoint.sh ash - ...   Up       0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
```

Note:  init-db initializes the db and will exit after DB has been initialize.  If the DB initialization is successful, it should exit with status 0 (i.e. `Exit 0`).

## Stop the API Node
```
$ docker-compose down
```

## Restart the API Node
```
$ docker-compose restart
```

## Reset the API Node
```
$ docker-compose down
$ ./reset.sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Check logs
There are 2 ways to view the logs:
1. docker logs
```
$ docker-compose logs --tail=100 -f
```

2. log files in `logs` directory

## Common Issue
*Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<catapult::catapult_error<std::invalid_argument> >
catapult-api-node_1  | std::exception::what: cannot insert element with height XXXXX when cache height is YYYYY*

The error occur when the node's blockchain height and the cache height is not the same.   This can occur due to unexpected exit when the software is writing blocks to the node's blockchain database.  The node will need to be [reset](#Reset-the-API-Node) as mentioned above.
